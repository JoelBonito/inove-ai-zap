# Create Progress Bar Workflow

1. Create or overwrite the file `docs/05-Relatorios/progress-bar.md`.
2. Write the following initial content:
   ```markdown
   # Progresso do Projeto

   **Status Geral:** 0%
   `░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░`

   _Última atualização: (Data atual)_
   ```
3. Notify the user that the progress bar file has been initialized.
4. Run the `/progress-bar` workflow to calculate the real initial status based on the task list.
